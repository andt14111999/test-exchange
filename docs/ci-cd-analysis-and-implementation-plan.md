# CI/CD Analysis and Implementation Plan

## Project Understanding

### Mono Repo Structure

This project is organized as a monorepo containing three main components:

1. **Exchange Backend** (`/`) - Ruby on Rails application

   - Ruby 3.2.2
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Redis for caching/jobs
   - Sidekiq for background jobs
   - Clockwork for scheduling
   - API endpoints using Grape
   - Admin interface using ActiveAdmin
   - Authentication with Devise + JWT

2. **Client** (`/client/`) - Next.js frontend application

   - Next.js 15.2.3 with React 19
   - TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - pnpm as package manager
   - Internationalization with next-intl
   - Testing with Jest and Playwright

3. **Engine** (`/engine/`) - Java trading engine
   - Java 17 (despite pom.xml showing 11, tests use 23)
   - Maven build system
   - Kafka for messaging
   - RocksDB for persistence
   - High-performance trading engine with LMAX Disruptor

### Current CI/CD State

#### Existing Workflows

- **Backend Testing**: `backend-rspec.yml` - Comprehensive RSpec tests with coverage reporting
- **Backend Quality**: `backend-rubocop.yml` - Ruby linting and style checks
- **Client Testing**: Multiple workflows for different test types (unit, e2e, playwright)
- **Client Quality**: Code quality, translations, and build checks
- **Engine Testing**: `engine-tests.yml` - Java tests with JaCoCo coverage
- **Security & Quality**: Bundle audit, security scans, ERB lint, DB consistency
- **Current Deployment**: AWS ECS deployment for backend (copied from admin-portal project)
- **Legacy Deployment**: Old Dokku-based deploy.yml (to be replaced)

#### Issues with Current Setup

1. **Limited Scope**: Only backend is deployed via AWS ECS, no client or engine deployment
2. **Inconsistent Deployment**: deploy.yml still uses outdated Dokku, while deploy-production.yml uses modern AWS ECS
3. **Monolithic Approach**: Current AWS deployment only handles backend components
4. **Partial Container Registry**: ECR only set up for backend (`admin-portal` repository)
5. **Single Component Focus**: AWS infrastructure not extended to client and engine

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

#### 1.1 Container Registry Strategy

- **Backend**: Already configured for ECR (`admin-portal` repository) with working AWS ECS deployment
- **Client**: Need new ECR repository (`exchange-client`) following admin-portal pattern
- **Engine**: Need new ECR repository (`exchange-engine`) following admin-portal pattern

#### 1.2 Environment Configuration

- **Production**: Current AWS ECS production environment (already configured for backend)
- **Development/Staging**: Can extend existing AWS infrastructure to support client and engine components

### Phase 2: Workflow Refactoring

#### 2.1 Modular Job Structure

Transform current deployment to use reusable workflows:

```yaml
# Existing workflows to maintain:
- assets.yml (backend assets)
- bundle-audit.yml (backend security)
- client-build.yml (client build)
- client-code-quality.yml (client quality)
- client-jest-tests.yml (client unit tests)
- client-playwright-tests.yml (client e2e tests)
- client-tests.yml (client comprehensive tests)
- client-translations.yml (client i18n)
- db-consistency.yml (backend DB)
- erb-lint.yml (backend templates)
- backend-rspec.yml (backend tests)
- backend-rubocop.yml (backend style)
- security.yml (security scans)
- zeitwerk.yml (backend autoloader)
- engine-tests.yml (engine tests)
```

#### 2.2 New Workflows Needed

```yaml
# Additional workflows to create:
- engine-build.yml (engine Docker build)
- integration-tests.yml (cross-component testing)
- deploy-client.yml (client deployment following deploy-production.yml pattern)
- deploy-engine.yml (engine deployment following deploy-production.yml pattern)

# Workflow updates needed:
- Replace deploy.yml (Dokku) with updated deploy-production.yml approach
- Extend deploy-production.yml to orchestrate all three components
```

### Phase 3: Deployment Pipeline Design

#### 3.1 Deployment Order & Dependencies

```
Backend Deploy → Client Deploy → Engine Deploy
     ↓              ↓              ↓
  Database      API Client    Trading Engine
  API Server    Static Site   Event Processing
  Admin Portal  User Interface Market Operations
```

**Rationale for Order:**

1. **Backend First**: Provides APIs that client depends on
2. **Client Second**: UI layer depends on backend APIs being available
3. **Engine Last**: Trading engine consumes events from backend and can be deployed independently

#### 3.2 Environment-Specific Configurations

##### Production Environment (Current)

- Backend already deployed to AWS ECS cluster with proper configuration
- Uses production databases, Redis, and load balancers
- Has monitoring and logging via CloudWatch and Rollbar
- Pattern established in deploy-production.yml

##### Extension Strategy

- Extend existing AWS ECS infrastructure to include client and engine
- Follow proven admin-portal deployment pattern for consistency
- Leverage existing AWS resources and security configurations

### Phase 4: ECS Infrastructure Requirements

#### 4.1 Backend Services (Existing)

- `admin-portal-web` - Rails web server
- `admin-portal-clockwork` - Scheduled jobs
- `admin-portal-sidekiq` - Background jobs

#### 4.2 Client Services (New)

- `exchange-client-web` - Next.js application server

#### 4.3 Engine Services (New)

- `exchange-engine-app` - Trading engine application
- `exchange-kafka` - Kafka message broker (if not shared)

### Phase 5: Integration Testing Strategy

#### 5.1 Component Integration

- Backend API availability tests
- Client-Backend API integration tests
- Engine-Backend event flow tests

#### 5.2 Health Check Endpoints

- Backend: Rails health check endpoint
- Client: Next.js health API route
- Engine: JVM health metrics endpoint

### Phase 6: Rollback Strategy

#### 6.1 Deployment Safeguards

- Health checks before marking deployment successful
- Automatic rollback on failed health checks
- Blue-green deployment capability for zero-downtime

#### 6.2 Component Isolation

- Each component can be rolled back independently
- Database migrations handled separately with backup strategy

## Security Considerations

### 6.1 Secrets Management

- AWS secrets for database connections
- API keys for external services
- Inter-service authentication tokens

### 6.2 Network Security

- Private subnets for internal communication
- Load balancers for external access
- VPC security groups for component isolation

## Monitoring and Observability

### 7.1 Application Monitoring

- Rollbar for error tracking (already configured)
- CloudWatch for infrastructure metrics
- Custom dashboards for business metrics

### 7.2 Deployment Monitoring

- GitHub Actions workflow status
- ECS service health monitoring
- Automated alerts for failed deployments

## Success Metrics

### 8.1 Deployment Metrics

- Deployment success rate > 95%
- Deployment time < 20 minutes for full stack
- Zero-downtime deployments

### 8.2 Quality Metrics

- Test coverage maintained > 90% for all components
- Security scan pass rate 100%
- Performance regression detection

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Infrastructure Extension

- Create ECR repositories for client and engine (backend ECR already exists)
- Set up ECS task definitions and services for client and engine (backend ECS already working)
- Configure secrets for client and engine components (backend secrets already configured)

### Week 2: Workflow Development

- Create component-specific build and deploy workflows
- Implement integration testing workflows
- Set up deployment pipeline orchestration

### Week 3: Testing and Validation

- Deploy to development environment
- Run comprehensive integration tests
- Performance and security validation

### Week 4: Production Rollout

- Production deployment with monitoring
- Rollback testing and validation
- Documentation and team training

## Risk Mitigation

### 9.1 Deployment Risks

- **Risk**: Component deployment failures
- **Mitigation**: Independent component rollback capability

### 9.2 Performance Risks

- **Risk**: Increased deployment time
- **Mitigation**: Parallel builds where possible, optimized container images

### 9.3 Security Risks

- **Risk**: Exposed secrets or credentials
- **Mitigation**: AWS Secrets Manager integration, least-privilege IAM policies

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### What Was Implemented

**✅ Complete CI/CD Pipeline for Exchange Monorepo**

- **Phase 1**: Backend deployment (web, sidekiq, clockwork, kafka-consumer)
- **Phase 2**: Client deployment (Next.js frontend)
- **Phase 3**: Engine deployment (Java trading engine)

**✅ Updated deployment-production.yml**

- Region: `us-west-2` (prod2 environment)
- ECR Repositories: `exchange-backend-f899186`, `exchange-client-59deea6`, `exchange-engine-0480f75`
- ECS Cluster: `exchange-base-cluster-prod2`
- All services correctly mapped to prod2 infrastructure

**✅ Deployment Flow**

1. **Backend**: Builds Rails app → Deploys web/sidekiq/clockwork/kafka-consumer services
2. **Client**: Builds Next.js app → Deploys client service (depends on backend)
3. **Engine**: Builds Java app → Deploys engine service (depends on client)

**✅ Environment Configuration**

- Target: `prod2` environment in `us-west-2`
- Rollbar integration for deployment tracking
- Proper AWS credentials and ECR authentication
- Sequential deployment with stability checks

### Usage

**Trigger Deployment:**

```bash
# Push to main branch triggers full stack deployment
git push origin main
```

**Deployment Order:**

1. All tests pass (backend, client, engine)
2. Backend services deploy sequentially
3. Client deploys after backend completion
4. Engine deploys after client completion
5. Rollbar notification sent on completion

### Next Steps

1. **Test Deployment**: Trigger a test deployment to validate the pipeline
2. **Monitor Services**: Verify all services deploy and run correctly
3. **Production Migration**: Apply same pattern to production environment
4. **Documentation**: Document deployment process for team

This plan provides a comprehensive approach to modernizing the CI/CD pipeline while maintaining system reliability and enabling independent component deployments.
